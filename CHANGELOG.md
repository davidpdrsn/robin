## Unreleased

### Added

- `Config` has gotten a `redis_url` field. That URL will be used when connecting to Redis in workers and clients. Defaults to `redis://127.0.0.1/`.
- `perform_now` has been added back. It can be called on anything that also has `perform_later`, but will block and perform the job right now.
- Make the `perform_with` attribute on `#[derive(Job)]` optional. Will default to a function called `perform_my_job` if the enum variant is `MyJob`.
